# Using this handler, failed messages will be retried with an exponential
# backoff delay, for a certain number of times, until they are dead-lettered.
#
# The specific strategy was adapted from the following sources:
#   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff

# It results in the following values:

# To use it you need to defined this handler in your worker:
#
# from_queue "my-app.queue_name",
#   exchange: "my_exchange_name",
#   routing_key: "my_routing_key",
#   handler: SneakersHandlers::ConventionalExponentialBackoffHandler,
#   arguments: { "x-dead-letter-exchange" => "my_exchange_name.dlx",
#                "x-dead-letter-routing-key" => "my-app.queue_name" }}
#
# The following defaults can be overriden:
#   max_retries: 20     # The number of times it retries before dead-lettering a message.
#
# from_queue "my-app.queue_name",
#   exchange: "my_exchange_name",
#   routing_key: "my_routing_key",
#   max_retries: 10,
#   handler: SneakersHandlers::ConventionalExponentialBackoffHandler,
#   arguments: { "x-dead-letter-exchange" => "my_exchange_name.dlx",
#                "x-dead-letter-routing-key" => "my-app.queue_name" }}
